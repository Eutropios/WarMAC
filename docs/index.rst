Welcome to WarMAC's documentation!
==================================

**WarMAC** (/'wɔr'mæk/)is a command-line Python script that can calculate the average
market price of items in Warframe.  It compiles orders from the fan website
`warframe.market <https://warframe.market/>`_, and can be used to find the
average prices of almost any tradeable item.
