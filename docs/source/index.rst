|  Warframe Market Average Calculator, or WarMAC (/'wɔr'mæk/) for short, is a
   command-line Python script that can calculate the average market price of any
   tradeable item in Warframe. It does this by retrieving orders of a specific
   item from the fan website `Warframe Market <https://warframe.market/>`_, and
   then calculates then average buy or sell price of that item.

|  WarMAC currently supports all Python versions 3.8 to 3.12 inclusive.
