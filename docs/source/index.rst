Welcome to WarMAC's documentation!
==================================

**WarMAC** (/'wɔr'mæk/)is a command-line Python script that can calculate the
average market price of items in Warframe.  It compiles orders from the fan
website `warframe.market <https://warframe.market/>`_, and can be used to find
the average prices of any tradeable item.
