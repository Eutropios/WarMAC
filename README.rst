WarMAC
=======

| **WarMAC** is a Python script that calculates the mean price of platinum for a specific item in Warframe.
| The script uses listings from the fan website *https://warframe.market/*.
| Currently this script does not use command-line arguments within the program.
| This project is incomplete, and is mainly just an exercise for myself.
| There are many bugs, and there are many features that I would like to add.
| Version 1.3.5
| **Version of Python required: 3.6**
| **External packages required: requests, colorama**

| IN PROGRESS:
|    Adding error handling for failed requests.
|    Addng error handling for no listings
|    Switching script to STRICTLY command line (maybe keep mixed one as an alternative for less
|    technically inclined users?)
| TO ADD:
|    THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. Additional error handling, expansion of time lookup
|    dates, and deleting lowest/highest sell prices to keep average in line are coming soon.
| IDEAS:
|    Graph functionality for listing prices over time?
|    List top most expensive items? (Might be extremely hard given the amount of items within db)
