WarMAC
=======

| **WarMAC** is a Python script that calculates the mean price of platinum for a specific item in Warframe.
| The script uses listings from the fan website *https://warframe.market/*. Currently this script does not use command-line arguments within the program.
| This project is incomplete, and is mainly just an exercise for myself. There are many bugs, and there are many features that I would like to add.
| **This project is NOT affiliated with Warframe, Digital Extremes, or the Warframe Market.**
