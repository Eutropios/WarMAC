<h1>WarMAC Version 1.5</h1>

**WarMAC** is a Python script that calculates the mean price of platinum for a specific item in Warframe.  
The script uses listings from the fan website *<https://warframe.market/>*.  
This project is incomplete, and is mainly just an exercise for myself.

**Version of Python required: 3.10**  
**External packages required: urllib3**  

*TO REPORT AN ISSUE, PLEASE OPEN AN ISSUE AT <https://github.com/Eutropios/wfmarket-calc/issues>*  
This project is currently not available on PyPi. However, I am diligently working on adding functionality before the first official release.  
UPCOMING:  
> Mod rank and Arcane rank handling, show average from buy orders instead of sell orders, add drop sources tag, and deleting lowest/highest sell prices to keep average in line are coming soon. Possibly adding more average types.
