## Installation<a id="installation"></a> <!--This ensures PyPI compatibility-->

WarMAC only supports Python versions 3.8 to 3.12. There are currently no plans to add support to Python 3.7

### Using Pip

Full installation instructions can be found in the official documentation.

Currently, the primary method of installing WarMAC is by installing it through pip. This can be done using the following command:

| Platform | Command |
|---|---|
| UNIX/MacOS | `python -m pip install warmac` |
| Windows | `py -m pip install warmac` |

You can ensure that you've installed WarMAC correctly by calling its help page like so:

```shell
warmac --version
```

### Using Poetry

WarMAC can also be installed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) either through the provided [`poetry.lock`](https://github.com/Eutropios/WarMAC/blob/main/poetry.lock) file (recommended), or by building a lock of your own.

To obtain the source code, you can either download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/Eutropios/WarMAC/releases), or by cloning the repository using [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eutropios/WarMAC.git ./some/directory
```

WarMAC can then be built by navigating to the directory you cloned WarMAC into, and running the `poetry build` and `poetry install` commands.

## Usage<a id="usage"></a>

### General Usage

Full usage instructions as well as examples can be found in the [official documentation](https://warmac.readthedocs.io/en/).

WarMAC has a variety of subcommands for users to select from. Each subcommand has its own unique options and arguments. Wherever possible, options that perform similar functions for different subcommands will share the same name.

Every WarMAC subcommand is preceded by ``warmac``. The general help section of the program can be viewed by running `warmac --help`.

To view a specific subcommand's usage from the command line, simply run:
`warmac <command> --help`

For example, to view the usage for the average subcommand, users should run:
`warmac average --help`

### Handling WarMAC Output

WarMAC accepts outgoing pipes just like any other tool:

```bash
$ warmac average -p=ps4 -t=5 -v "bite" | grep "Time Range"
Time Range Used:             10 days
```

WarMAC output can also be redirected to a file:

```bash
$ warmac average -p PC -t 2 -v "vengeful revenant" > warmacOut.txt
$ cat warmacOut.txt
Item:                  Vengeful Revenant
Statistic Found:       Median
Time Range Used:       2 days
Median Price:          5.0 platinum
Max Price:             30 platinum
Min Price:             4 platinum
Number of Orders:      38
```
