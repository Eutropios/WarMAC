**WarMAC** is a command-line Python script that can calculate the average market price of items in Warframe.  
WarMAC compiles orders from the fan website *<https://warframe.market/>*, and can be used to find the average prices of prime parts, tradeable parts, relics, mods, and arcane enhancements.  
WarMAC has the ability to:  

* Target PC, PlayStation, XBOX, or Nintendo Switch platforms.
* Calculate the median, mean, mode, harmonic mean, or geometric means of items.
* Restrict orders to specific time ranges.
* Utilize either seller or buyer orders.
* Find averages for intact or radiant relics.
* Find average for unranked or max-ranked mods and arcane enhancements.
* Display additional information about an item on the market.
