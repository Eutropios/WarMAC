**WarMAC** is a command-line Python script that can calculate the average market price of items in Warframe.
WarMAC compiles seller orders from the fan website *<https://warframe.market/>*, and has the option to target specific platforms, pull data from specific time frames, and find the mean, median, mode, or harmonic mean averages.
