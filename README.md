# wfm-avg-calculator
This is a command line Python script that calculates the mean price of platinum for a specific item in Warframe.
The script uses listings from the fan website <i>https://warframe.market/<i>. Currently this script does not use command-line arguments within the program.
This project is incomplete, and is mainly just an exercise for myself. There are many bugs, and there are many features that I would like to add. <br>
